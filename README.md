## Ethical Implications
When building our food recipe web application, we have a professional responsibility to ensure that the platform is secure, accessible, and promotes a positive user experience. Protecting user data, particularly account information and personal preferences, is critical to maintaining user trust. We must follow ethical coding practices by preventing vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or insecure password storage through the proper use of libraries like Flask-Login and SQLAlchemy.

From a global perspective, our application could reach users from diverse cultural backgrounds. Therefore, designing the app to be inclusive and user-friendly is important to avoid alienating certain groups. Economically, the platform could help users find affordable, home-cooked meal ideas, potentially reducing food waste and grocery costs for families around the world.

Environmentally, promoting home-cooked meals may also indirectly contribute to sustainability efforts by encouraging users to buy local produce and reduce packaging waste associated with processed foods. On a societal level, the application fosters a sense of community by allowing users to share recipes, comment, and connect over food, which is an important aspect of cultural and social identity.

Overall, our engineering decisions must balance functionality, security, inclusivity, and broader impacts to deliver a product that is both ethical and beneficial for users worldwide.
